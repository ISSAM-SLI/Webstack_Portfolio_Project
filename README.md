8. **Result Page**: A page where users can view their scores, feedback and review their answers.
9. **Testing & Debugging**: Ensuring all components work smoothly and fixing bugs.
10. **Documentation & Deployment**: Writing documentation and deploying the app for public use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x** - You need to have Python installed on your system.
2. **Flask** - The web framework used to build this app.
3. **SQLite** - Database engine to store user data and quiz results.
4. **Virtual environment** - A virtual environment manager like `venv` or `virtualenv`
5. **Dependies** - Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ISSAM-SLI/Webstack_Portfolio_Project.git
   cd Webstack_Portfolio_Project
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
The app requires two environment variables to run:

**SECRET_KEY:** Used to secure the sessions and prevent tampering.

**DATABASE_URI:** The URI for connecting to your database.

You can set these environment variables in one of the following ways:

**Option 1:** Using **.env file** (recommended for development)

Create a .env file in the root of the project directory and add the following lines:
```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri_here
```
Make sure to replace **your_secret_key_here** with a random string (you can generate one using secrets.token_hex(16)) and **your_database_uri_here** with **the URI for your database**.Otherwise, The default **DATABASE_URI** is set to use an SQLite database **sqlite:///quizapp.db**

**Option 2:** Manually setting environment variables
You can manually set the environment variables in your terminal session before running the app. For example:

On Linux/macOS:
```
export SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here # For Windows, use set SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
export DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri_here # For Windows, use set DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri_here
```

**Additional Notes:**

**Generating a secret key:** To generate a random secret key, you can use Pythonâ€™s secrets module:

```
import secrets
print(secrets.token_hex(16))
```
**Database setup:** The default **DATABASE_URI** is set to use an SQLite database **(sqlite:///quizapp.db)**. If you need to use a different database, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, you can update the **DATABASE_URI** in the .env file or set it as an environment variable accordingly.

5. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python3 run.py
   ```

   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to start the quiz!
